# LFS 12.4-52 (17th December 2025)

IMPORTANT - do NOT run anything from this repo unless you are also reading along with the LFS book. I make no claims as to the effectiveness or usefulness of my own scripts, which are written for my own use. I assume no responsibility for any damage caused by running these, this will entirely be at your own risk.

## Why is this here?

After a couple of false starts, I determined the best way to approach this project is to have the commands I intend to rn scripted out, organised by chapter and page-subject. I can then work systematically and make debugging easier. 

## Structure

I may post an update here that shows the relationship between chapters and pages, and the folders inside the repo. Then again, I may not.
